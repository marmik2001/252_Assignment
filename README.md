A multithreaded java program that outputs prime numbers. The user will run the program and will enter a number on the command line. The program will then create a
separate thread that outputs all the prime numbers less than or equal to the number entered by the user.

## Fibonacci.java
A multithreaded java program that generates the Fibonacci sequence. On the command line, the user will enter the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate.
The program will then create a separate thread that will generate the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that can be shared by the threads (using an array). 
The parent thread waits for the child thread to finish and when the child thread finishes execution, it outputs
the sequence generated.
